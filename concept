Like B, but...
- High degree of indirection, even for functions: every global is a pointer in
  text/data (idk if B did this). Before compiling each function, every
  undefined global is allocated a reference.
- $[ for indexing/dimensioning byte arrays, e.g. auto a$[40], a$[10] = 17.
- Support for static keyword.
- C-style operators, += instead of =+ .
